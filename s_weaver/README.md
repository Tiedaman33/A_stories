# finally resolved the disturbign error of failing to fetch the current user. i realised that axios automatically handles parsing and didint need to use await response.json
# also, i directly used setUserData(response.data) in handling handling. instead of  setUserData(data) since the user data had been parsed from the Axios repsonse.
